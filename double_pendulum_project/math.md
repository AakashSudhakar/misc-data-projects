## DOUBLE PENDULUM: Mathematics Work

***
<h3>The following is the calculations file describing the steps in solving the differential equations that represent both pendulums' equations of motion.</h3>

<h3>We start by examining the basic equations of motion in the x- and y-dimension</h4>

$$sin(theta) + 1 = cos(theta)$$ (1)
